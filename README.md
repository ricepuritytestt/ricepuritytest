# RicePurityTest
This test is comprised of 100 questions from very versatile domains including your personal sex life, drug history to very simple questions. This test was formed in Rice University in 1924. It was initiated as a fun for the new students to interact with their classmates so they can bond eachother with the rice purity test score. The more the score you have in this test, the more you're assume to be innocent and pure.
